        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I started this coding journey in December 2017. It was just curiousity at the time, i never thought there was hope and i felt that was'nt deserving of a better career.</p>
        <p>I thought because all i knew was how to be a mechanic that there was no way to change careers, to live the life i only dreamt of.</p>
        <p>However i quickly found out that i was lying to myself and infact a prisoner of my own thoughts, i decided 2018 was going to be my year of change to draw out where i want to be 5 years from now.</p>
        <p>I decided this is my year of conquest as we all need something to reach for this is my year of reach, to get out of the normal and get out of the box. Break the routine and do exceedingly abundantly above.</p>
        <p>I put my fears of change behind me and challenged myself to pursue my dreams. Understanding that it takes a while to draw out who i am, but i am starting here with this TechDegree.</p>
