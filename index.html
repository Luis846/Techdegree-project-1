        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring software engineer who loves everything about coding. I find it amazing how one can create something from nothing. Im looking forward for the upcoming months as i mold myself into a great developer. </p>
        <p>Before i decided to take this journey into software development field, i was an ASE certified mechanic. Cars were all i knew and even though i still love working on them i decided it's better if i put cars as a hobby and look into a new field.
        I chose this field because i have a dream of one day working with SpaceX, as i am also fascinated with Space. </p>
